                As you get in deeper, you find a steep cave hallway. You see a lot of water drops pour second by second, it's called saliva. 
                The salivary gland produces saliva and enzymes to chemically digest food. Or uses the chemicals in the saliva to break down food. 
                You slip on the saliva and slide down into the stomach

                you fall into a lake of stomach acids and enzymes.

                As you enter the pyloric sphincter, you have a choice, go up or down.

                <p>
                You decide to go up for some reason and see, stacks and stacks of bile.
                Bile is a greenish brownish substance used to help digestion. 
                It usually is empty after a meal. Like a fool, you go upward.

                <h1>Liver Landfill</h1>

                <p>
                You enter the liver and see tons and tons of waste.
                The liver has over 500 functions, but they are known for storing waste and creating bile.
                You canâ€™t bother with this as it's a dead end, so you hop back down to the Gallbladder and go into the pancreas.

                <h1>Pancreas Factory</h1>

                <p>
                You enter the pancreas to see rusty machines, and its sole purpose is to convert food into energy.
                You see they are broken and non-functional. You get back into the gallbladder and head back to the pyloric sphincter

                <h1>Small Intestine Maze</h1>

                <p>
                You enter the small intestine and see as it's very confusing, all these twist and turns, well that's because it slows down digestion so you don't excrete waste after you eat.
                Also you see a lot of bile and pancreatic juices with aid digestion. After a half an hour you finally make it out into the large intestine

                <p>
                You enter the large intestine and you feel the mushy floor.
                The large intestine absorbs the water in waste and sends the nerves a message that you need to go do your business.
                You make it to the end of the large intestine and make it to the rectum.
                </p>

                <h1>Rectum Exit</h1>

                <p>
                 You enter the rectum, but then, you remember the rectum holds up waste until the nerves tell the rectum to release.
                You start running as the walls close in! As you make it to the anus, you make it out of the cave, like how a piece of food goes throughout the digestive system to make it to the toilet.
                You finished your journey around Digestive Island.
